<p>According to reports that have recently emerged from <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mike-van-der-hoorn-comments-15778557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Wales Online</a>, Mike Van Der Hoorn – the 26-year-old Swansea City defender, whose contract is scheduled to run out at the end of the season, has triggered interest from Aston Villa, who are keen to bring the Dutchman to Villa Park in the upcoming summer transfer window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the possibility of promotion still very real, Villa will be hoping that they are able to convince the experienced campaigner to make the switch across the country. Currently in ninth place, they will be aiming to make it to the play-off spots before the end of the season.</p>

                    [content] => Reports from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8317423/newcastle-transfer-news-nantes-anthony-limbombe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Sun</a> are suggesting that Newcastle were close to completing a deal for Nantes’ midfielder Anthony Limbombe. He joined the Ligue 1 club from Club Brugge just over 6 months ago.

Newcastle have recently been displaying improvement in terms of motivation and the willingness to play for the team. Rafa has clearly been able to get the message across to his players that things had to change quickly if they wanted top-flight football next year.

After destroying Cardiff at St.James’ Park, they went on to get an unbelievable win against title contenders Manchester City and left a major dent on their hopes of catching runaway leaders Liverpool.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2019/01/29221110/Salomon.Rondon.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for newcastle vs man city\" width=\"700\" height=\"367\" />

Having had less than 25% possession at the end of the game, Newcastle had to dig really deep to pull out what was a historic victory for the Magpies. They really did put Manchester City to the sword in front of the old Toon faithful at St.James’ Park.

All the players were excellent and everyone worked extra shifts that night to maintain the precious points. Christian Atsu on the left was helping out the defence but going forward, he still seems to lack Premier League quality and a new signing could’ve changed the complexion of this Magpies side.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_912,h_516,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/fbl-fra-ligue1-nantes-rennes-5c52f5c1e37d34df3e000010.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for limbombe\" width=\"744\" height=\"421\" />
As suggested by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8317423/newcastle-transfer-news-nantes-anthony-limbombe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Sun</a>, Anthony Limbombe was linked with the Magpies for a potential switch to the Premier League. He joined Nantes only at the beginning of this season.

He has made 16 Ligue 1 appearances this campaign but 10 of those have come off the bench and he is yet to assist or score. He has scored one goal for the club, in the Coupe De France.

He is a pacy left winger who loves to cut in onto his right. While he is capable of finding some neat passes from that position, he tends to unleash a powerful strike that seems to travel past the defenders at the speed of sound.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://nbocdn.akamaized.net/Assets/Images_Upload/2018/03/02/a298a65c-1e14-11e8-be09-28cf9e87edd7_web_scale_0.0710227_0.0710227__.jpg?maxheight=460&amp;maxwidth=638&amp;scale=both\" alt=\"Image result for limbombe\" width=\"632\" height=\"421\" />
He could’ve provided more to the team than Atsu and was even more likely to score goals in the Newcastle system. He also likes to get powerful crosses into the box, which would’ve suited Salomon Rondón as well.

Extremely confident on the ball, his movement down the left flank would’ve been useful to Rafa in the latter stages of the season. With Kenedy’s eventual return to Chelsea imminent, a deal for the KRC Genk academy product would’ve been a good move by Benitez.

                    [post_title] => Benfica B starlet Mesaque Dju Moving to West Ham?
                    [content] => Reports from <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11622643/west-ham-sign-benfica-winger-mesaque-dju-on-free-transfer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sky Sports</a> are suggesting that Benfica B starlet Mesaque Dju has moved to <a href=\"https://soccersouls.com/category/epl-3/west-ham-united/\">West Ham</a>, who have made their second signing of the winter transfer window after buying in Samir Nasri earlier.

Dju is a pacy right-winger who likes to get up and down the flank very often. While he has a massive tank, he is an extremely intelligent footballer for a 19-year-old.

The timing of his runs and the weight of his passes are usually excellent, while he is extremely fast with and without the ball. He is also a very good dribbler, capable of working in crowded spaces and pulling off the odd trick.

He played for the Benfica B team but didn’t make a first-team appearance for the club. He was at the club since childhood and grew in the Benfica academy.

Born in Bissau, he chose to pledge his loyalty to Portugal and has even represented them at all the youth levels from U16 to U20, a period during which he even scored 14 goals. He played 21 games in all competitions for his club this season and scored twice.

But the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8311354/west-ham-sign-mesaque-dju-benfica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sun</a> claims that Benfica put a sell-on clause in the contract, which gives them 50% of the transfer fee that West Ham sell him for in the future. This is a massive deal for Benfica as well, who would benefit greatly from the clause.

He is still only 19, which means that we could go into the West Ham academy where he can get used to the English game before slowly being eased into the first-team picture.

While they have made massive signings in the transfer window at the start of the season, it’s the smaller deals like this that usually pay off. He certainly has the potential to be a star in the near future.

His pace and attacking prowess will certainly suit the English style of play and under the guidance of players like Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko, he can become one of the best.

His dreams of eventually playing for the Portuguese national side could also come true if he shows the world what he’s capable of in the Premier League. This move was a no-brainer for Pellegrini as this is a player who can only get better.

                    [content] => According to reports from <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/3800760/rangers-james-tavernier-targeted-southampton-8m-transfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Scottish Sun</a>, Rangers captain James Tavernier has triggered interest from Southampton’s Austrian coach Ralph Hasenhuttl, who is keen on bringing the Englishman to St.Mary’s.

Southampton have had to endure a pretty difficult season so far, which has even seen a managerial change midway through the campaign. Claude Puel’s men were in a miserable run of form when he was fired.

When Hasenhuttl did take over though, the changes were immediate and clear to see. He seemed to bring the life and willingness back in to an obviously highly talented squad.

<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-46737 size-full\" src=\"https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cedric-Soares-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" />

Currently in an awkward 15th place with 22 points on the board after 23 matches, Saints will be looking forward to facing Crystal Palace in the Premier League, who are on the back of an impressive FA Cup win against Tottenham.

They are unbeaten in their last 3 league games, having drawn 0-0 against a high-flying Chelsea and got impressive, hard-fought victories against Leicester City and Everton.

They’ve managed to launch themselves out of the relegation zone but still have a long way to go before they are completely devoid of the threat. The transfer market could be a perfect way to cover that gap.

There’s a serious need for strengthening in this side considering the departure of one of their most important players. Cedric Soares has joined Inter Milan on loan.

<img class=\"size-full wp-image-47715 aligncenter\" src=\"https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/James-Tavernier-Rangers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"746\" />

With their star right-back leaving, the only remaining option in that position is the 19-year-old Yan Valery. Although he’s been very good so far, it’s not smart to depend on an unproven youngster for a long duration.

As suggested by <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/3800760/rangers-james-tavernier-targeted-southampton-8m-transfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Scottish Sun</a>, James Tavernier of Rangers is the man that Hasenhuttl has identified as the potential replacement. He is an English product who has had spells at <a href=\"https://soccersouls.com/category/epl-3/newcastle-united\">Newcastle</a>, Wigan, MK Dons and even Bristol City.

The 28-year-old is a crucial part of Steven Gerrard’s squad at Ibrox and has contributed heavily to the side as well. Having played 38 games in all competitions, he has scored 9 times and assisted 14.

For a right-back, those are explosive numbers. Also, his pace and ability to beat a man are feared in Scotland and he could become an asset to Hasenhuttl’s side. His crossing ability is also highly rated while he is primarily a defender.

<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/SNS-14597114-Ayr-v-Rangers.jpg-900x540.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for james tavernier\" />

His movement and leadership skills will be crucial to the Saints this campaign if Hasenhuttl is able to convince the Englishman to swap Glasgow for the coastal city of Southampton.

With their star right-back leaving, the only remaining option in that position is the 19-year-old Yan Valery. Although he’s been very good so far, it’s not smart to depend on an unproven youngster for a long duration.

As suggested by <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/3800760/rangers-james-tavernier-targeted-southampton-8m-transfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Scottish Sun</a>, James Tavernier of Rangers is the man that Hasenhuttl has identified as the potential replacement. He is an English product who has had spells at <a href=\"https://soccersouls.com/category/epl-3/newcastle-united\">Newcastle</a>, Wigan, MK Dons and even Bristol City.

The 28-year-old is a crucial part of Steven Gerrard’s squad at Ibrox and has contributed heavily to the side as well. Having played 38 games in all competitions, he has scored 9 times and assisted 14.

For a right-back, those are explosive numbers. Also, his pace and ability to beat a man are feared in Scotland and he could become an asset to Hasenhuttl’s side. His crossing ability is also highly rated while he is primarily a defender.

His movement and leadership skills will be crucial to the Saints this campaign if Hasenhuttl is able to convince the Englishman to swap Glasgow for the coastal city of Southampton.

Southampton have had to endure a pretty difficult season so far, which has even seen a managerial change midway through the campaign. Claude Puel’s men were in a miserable run of form when he was fired.

When Hasenhuttl did take over though, the changes were immediate and clear to see. He seemed to bring the life and willingness back in to an obviously highly talented squad.

Currently in an awkward 15th place with 22 points on the board after 23 matches, Saints will be looking forward to facing Crystal Palace in the Premier League, who are on the back of an impressive FA Cup win against Tottenham.

                    [post_title] => January Transfer to West Ham for Maxi Gomez
                    [content] => According to a report from <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11624084/west-ham-continue-talks-with-celta-vigo-for-maxi-gomez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sky Sports</a>, West Ham were very much keen on signing Celta Vigo striker Maxi Gomez in the January transfer window. However, a deal fell through and the player remained at Celta Vigo.

Maxi Gomez, 22, has been in sizzling form for Celta this season, scoring 9 goals and supplying 5 assists in 20 league games. That form didn’t go unnoticed, as West Ham tried signing the Uruguayan forward last month in the wake of Marko Arnautovic’s potential departure to China.

Marko Arnautovic dominated the headlines in English tabloids in the final few days of the winter transfer window. The Austrian was set for a move to China, however, Arnautovic stayed put at the club and even signed a new improved contract. But it looks like the 29-year-old will still move on in the summer.
<figure id=\"attachment_55041\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-55041\" src=\"https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Maxi-Gomez-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"557\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maxi Gomez</figcaption></figure>
And as it is apparent that Arnautovic will leave London Stadium at the end of the season, West Ham must reignite their interest in Maxi Gomez.

Maxi Gomez scored 19 La Liga goals in his first season in Spain and has managed to hit the ground for Celta this term as well. As Celta are flirting with relegation, the Uruguayan could be tempted to leave the Spanish side if West Ham come in with an eye-catching offer in the summer.

In Maxi Gomez, West Ham would get a burly forward filled with pace, power, aerial prowess and aerial ability. The 22-year-old has the physical attributes to cope with the Premier League demands and would offer the Hammers with a big presence in and around the box, which more creative players like Felipe Anderson and Samir Nasri can utilise.
<figure id=\"attachment_57428\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-57428\" src=\"https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Marko-Arnautovic-west-ham-2-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" srcset=\"https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Marko-Arnautovic-west-ham-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://soccersouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Marko-Arnautovic-west-ham-2.jpg 1368w\" alt=\"\" width=\"662\" height=\"442\" /></figure>
Add to that, the clever movement and his deadly finishing ability, the Uruguayan has the potential to be an excellent addition to the Hammers attack. At 22, Gomez has his best years ahead of him and his superb form this season for a struggling side speaks volumes about him.

Moreover, Arnautovic looks likely to quit West Ham at the end of the season. And hence, boosting the options in their attack this summer wouldn’t be the worst idea for Manuel Pellegrini. The Hammers would have to move in real quick to bag the signature of Maxi Gomez.

The 22-year-old has the physical attributes to cope with the Premier League demands and would offer the Hammers with a big presence in and around the box, which more creative players like Felipe Anderson and Samir Nasri can utilise.

Add to that, the clever movement and his deadly finishing ability, the Uruguayan has the potential to be an excellent addition to the Hammers attack. At 22, Gomez has his best years ahead of him and his superb form this season for a struggling side speaks volumes about him.

Moreover, Arnautovic looks likely to quit West Ham at the end of the season. And hence, boosting the options in their attack this summer wouldn’t be the worst idea for Manuel Pellegrini. The Hammers would have to move in real quick to bag the signature of Maxi Gomez.

However, a deal fell through and the player remained at Celta Vigo.

Maxi Gomez, 22, has been in sizzling form for Celta this season, scoring 9 goals and supplying 5 assists in 20 league games. That form didn’t go unnoticed, as West Ham tried signing the Uruguayan forward last month in the wake of Marko Arnautovic’s potential departure to China.

Marko Arnautovic dominated the headlines in English tabloids in the final few days of the winter transfer window. The Austrian was set for a move to China, however, Arnautovic stayed put at the club and even signed a new improved contract. But it looks like the 29-year-old will still move on in the summer.

    [content] => Reports from <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11622643/west-ham-sign-benfica-winger-mesaque-dju-on-free-transfer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sky Sports</a> are suggesting that Benfica B starlet Mesaque Dju has moved to <a href=\"https://soccersouls.com/category/epl-3/west-ham-united/\">West Ham</a>, who have made their second signing of the winter transfer window after buying in Samir Nasri earlier.

Dju is a pacy right-winger who likes to get up and down the flank very often. While he has a massive tank, he is an extremely intelligent footballer for a 19-year-old.

The timing of his runs and the weight of his passes are usually excellent, while he is extremely fast with and without the ball. He is also a very good dribbler, capable of working in crowded spaces and pulling off the odd trick.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Mesaque+Dju+England+v+Portugal+2017+UEFA+European+hnjuFGFmbQ2l.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />
He played for the Benfica B team but didn’t make a first-team appearance for the club. He was at the club since childhood and grew in the Benfica academy.

Born in Bissau, he chose to pledge his loyalty to Portugal and has even represented them at all the youth levels from U16 to U20, a period during which he even scored 14 goals. He played 21 games in all competitions for his club this season and scored twice.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://static.nexilia.it/alfredopedulla/2019/01/Mesaque-Dju-Portogallo-Foto-Record.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for mesaque dju\" width=\"751\" height=\"423\" />
But the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8311354/west-ham-sign-mesaque-dju-benfica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sun</a> claims that Benfica put a sell-on clause in the contract, which gives them 50% of the transfer fee that West Ham sell him for in the future. This is a massive deal for Benfica as well, who would benefit greatly from the clause.

He is still only 19, which means that we could go into the West Ham academy where he can get used to the English game before slowly being eased into the first-team picture.

While they have made massive signings in the transfer window at the start of the season, it’s the smaller deals like this that usually pay off. He certainly has the potential to be a star in the near future.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/Comp_Matches/02/36/41/52/2364152_w2.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for mesaque dju\" width=\"656\" height=\"369\" />
His pace and attacking prowess will certainly suit the English style of play and under the guidance of players like Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko, he can become one of the best.

His dreams of eventually playing for the Portuguese national side could also come true if he shows the world what he’s capable of in the Premier League. This move was a no-brainer for Pellegrini as this is a player who can only get better.

    [post_content] => Reports from <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11622643/west-ham-sign-benfica-winger-mesaque-dju-on-free-transfer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sky Sports</a> are suggesting that Benfica B starlet Mesaque Dju has moved to <a href=\"https://soccersouls.com/category/epl-3/west-ham-united/\">West Ham</a>, who have made their second signing of the winter transfer window after buying in Samir Nasri earlier.

Dju is a pacy right-winger who likes to get up and down the flank very often. While he has a massive tank, he is an extremely intelligent footballer for a 19-year-old.

The timing of his runs and the weight of his passes are usually excellent, while he is extremely fast with and without the ball. He is also a very good dribbler, capable of working in crowded spaces and pulling off the odd trick.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Mesaque+Dju+England+v+Portugal+2017+UEFA+European+hnjuFGFmbQ2l.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />
He played for the Benfica B team but didn’t make a first-team appearance for the club. He was at the club since childhood and grew in the Benfica academy.

Born in Bissau, he chose to pledge his loyalty to Portugal and has even represented them at all the youth levels from U16 to U20, a period during which he even scored 14 goals. He played 21 games in all competitions for his club this season and scored twice.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://static.nexilia.it/alfredopedulla/2019/01/Mesaque-Dju-Portogallo-Foto-Record.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for mesaque dju\" width=\"751\" height=\"423\" />
But the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8311354/west-ham-sign-mesaque-dju-benfica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sun</a> claims that Benfica put a sell-on clause in the contract, which gives them 50% of the transfer fee that West Ham sell him for in the future. This is a massive deal for Benfica as well, who would benefit greatly from the clause.

He is still only 19, which means that we could go into the West Ham academy where he can get used to the English game before slowly being eased into the first-team picture.

While they have made massive signings in the transfer window at the start of the season, it’s the smaller deals like this that usually pay off. He certainly has the potential to be a star in the near future.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/Comp_Matches/02/36/41/52/2364152_w2.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for mesaque dju\" width=\"656\" height=\"369\" />
His pace and attacking prowess will certainly suit the English style of play and under the guidance of players like Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko, he can become one of the best.

His dreams of eventually playing for the Portuguese national side could also come true if he shows the world what he’s capable of in the Premier League. This move was a no-brainer for Pellegrini as this is a player who can only get better.

He joined the Ligue 1 club from Club Brugge just over 6 months ago.

Newcastle have recently been displaying improvement in terms of motivation and the willingness to play for the team. Rafa has clearly been able to get the message across to his players that things had to change quickly if they wanted top-flight football next year.

After destroying Cardiff at St.James’ Park, they went on to get an unbelievable win against title contenders Manchester City and left a major dent on their hopes of catching runaway leaders Liverpool.

Having had less than 25% possession at the end of the game, Newcastle had to dig really deep to pull out what was a historic victory for the Magpies. They really did put Manchester City to the sword in front of the old Toon faithful at St.James’ Park.

All the players were excellent and everyone worked extra shifts that night to maintain the precious points. Christian Atsu on the left was helping out the defence but going forward, he still seems to lack Premier League quality and a new signing could’ve changed the complexion of this Magpies side.

As suggested by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8317423/newcastle-transfer-news-nantes-anthony-limbombe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the Sun</a>, Anthony Limbombe was linked with the Magpies for a potential switch to the Premier League. He joined Nantes only at the beginning of this season.

He has made 16 Ligue 1 appearances this campaign but 10 of those have come off the bench and he is yet to assist or score. He has scored one goal for the club, in the Coupe De France.

He is a pacy left winger who loves to cut in onto his right. While he is capable of finding some neat passes from that position, he tends to unleash a powerful strike that seems to travel past the defenders at the speed of sound.

<img class=\"irc_mi aligncenter\" src=\"https://nbocdn.akamaized.net/Assets/Images_Upload/2018/03/02/a298a65c-1e14-11e8-be09-28cf9e87edd7_web_scale_0.0710227_0.0710227__.jpg?maxheight=460&amp;maxwidth=638&amp;scale=both\" alt=\"Image result for limbombe\" width=\"632\" height=\"421\" />
He could’ve provided more to the team than Atsu and was even more likely to score goals in the Newcastle system. He also likes to get powerful crosses into the box, which would’ve suited Salomon Rondón as well.

Extremely confident on the ball, his movement down the left flank would’ve been useful to Rafa in the latter stages of the season. With Kenedy’s eventual return to Chelsea imminent, a deal for the KRC Genk academy product would’ve been a good move by Benitez.
